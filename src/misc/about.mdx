## About Conference

PyConf Hyderabad is the regional gathering for the community that uses and develops the open-source Python programming language. PyConf Hyderabad is organised by the Hyderabad Python User Group (HydPy) for the community. This conference is about sharing of knowledge, experience and allowing the growth of ideas which could lead to spillover of stronger ties between developers and users of Python with human interactions. The first iteration of the conference happened in 2017 and second was in 2019. Feel free to check out the links of previous year's website [2017](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2017/) & [2019](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2019/). We are continuing the legacy and happy to organize the 3rd edition of the conferenc this year.
