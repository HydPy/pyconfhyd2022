## COC

<p><strong>This “Dont be a jerk” policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick">Read full version</a>.</strong></p>

<p>PyConf Hyderabad is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, race, religion or employment. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. We have zero tolerance on harassment of conference participants in any form, including, but not limited to the activities mentioned here.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language or imagery is inappropriate for all aspects of the conference, including talks. Remember that sexist, racist or any other form of exclusionary or offensive jokes or excessive public swearing are not appropriate at any venue of PyConf Hyderabad.</p>

<p>Do not insult or put down attendees or engage in any action that violates the open, welcoming and sharing spirit of the conference. Be kind and sensitive to the people around you when you are attending the conference, and avoid any kind of offensive or degrading behavior.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping to make PyConf Hyderabad a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
