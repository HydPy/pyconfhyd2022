We are glad to announce our In-Kind Sponsor of PyConf Hyderabad 2022 - "MongoDB". We are super excited to partner with them for Hyderabad's own Python Conference. Below is the short description about the company. Feel free to check their website and follow them on social media.

MongoDB is the worldâ€™s leading developer data platform. Based on the document data model, MongoDB makes it intuitive to model data and evolve applications as requirements grow and change. With a unified query interface for a broad set of workload types, and the ability to power general-purpose application requirements along with more bespoke use cases like time series, MongoDB powers simpler, faster, and more flexible application development.
